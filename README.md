# MicroService
Microservice
Microservice is a concept that has been around for a decade, but it's only recently that it has become a mainstream approach to building software.

Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together to achieve the goals of the application. The advantages of microservices are many and include:

- Scalability: Microservices can be scaled independently and provide greater flexibility in scaling an application.

- Reusability: Microservices can be reused in other applications or projects with ease.

- Fault Tolerance: Microservices can be designed so that they will not affect the entire system if they fail, which increases the availability of the application.

- Development Velocity: Microservice architecture provides faster development velocity because developers can focus on one service at a time without having to wait for other services to finish before starting on another one.

So I started the code from basic to advanced of MicroServices with some Mini-Projects
